# Backend Integration Guide

This document explains how the Medi-Match frontend is integrated with the Hugging Face backend.

## Backend URL

The frontend is configured to connect to the Hugging Face Space backend at:
```
https://gungoo-medi-match-backend.hf.space
```

## Environment Configuration

The backend URL is configured in the `.env` file:
```
REACT_APP_FLASK_BACKEND_URL=https://gungoo-medi-match-backend.hf.space
REACT_APP_FLASK_URL=https://gungoo-medi-match-backend.hf.space
```

## Features Integrated

### 1. Medical Document Analysis
- **Endpoint**: `/process_image`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: JPEG/JPG image file (max 10MB)
- **Output**: AI diagnosis and medical insights
- **Location**: Medical Analysis page (`/medical_analysis`)

### 2. Clinical Trial Matching
- **Endpoint**: `/fetch_clinical_trials`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: User medical profile (age, gender, allergies, medications, diagnosis)
- **Output**: Matching clinical trials
- **Location**: Clinical Trial page (`/clinical_trial`)

## API Utility

The integration uses a centralized API utility (`src/utils/api.js`) that provides:

- **Centralized configuration**: Single place to manage backend URLs
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for common scenarios
- **Request/Response interceptors**: Logging and error processing
- **Timeout management**: 30-second timeout for AI processing
- **Health checks**: Backend status monitoring

## Backend Status Monitoring

Both pages include real-time backend status indicators:
- üîÑ **Checking**: Verifying backend connectivity
- ‚úÖ **Connected**: Backend is available and responding
- ‚ùå **Unavailable**: Backend is down or unreachable

## Error Handling

The integration handles various error scenarios:

- **503 Service Unavailable**: Backend is starting up
- **413 Payload Too Large**: File size exceeds limits
- **Connection Timeout**: Request takes too long
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues

## Usage Instructions

### For Medical Document Analysis:
1. Navigate to the Medical Analysis page
2. Wait for the backend status to show "‚úÖ Backend connected"
3. Upload a JPEG/JPG medical document (max 10MB)
4. Click "Upload File" to process
5. View AI diagnosis results

### For Clinical Trial Matching:
1. Navigate to the Clinical Trial page
2. Wait for the backend status to show "‚úÖ Backend connected"
3. Fill out your medical profile form
4. Click "Find Matching Trials"
5. View personalized clinical trial recommendations

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Responding
- Check if the Hugging Face Space is running
- Verify the backend URL in `.env` file
- Check browser console for error messages

### File Upload Issues
- Ensure file is JPEG/JPG format
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify backend status is "connected"

### Slow Response Times
- Hugging Face Spaces may take time to start up
- AI processing can take 10-30 seconds
- Check the loading indicators

## Development Notes

- The backend uses Hugging Face Spaces for deployment
- API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- All requests include proper error handling
- Status indicators provide real-time feedback
- Timeout is set to 30 seconds for AI processing

## Security Considerations

- File uploads are validated for type and size
- No sensitive data is stored locally
- All communication uses HTTPS
- Error messages don't expose sensitive backend information
